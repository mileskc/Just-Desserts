# Just-Desserts

# Project Summary

Just Desserts is a resource for anyone looking to find the best dessert places NYC has to offer. It offers an alphabetical list of locations and allows the user to browse by New York boroughs.

# Coding Approach

The first objective in building this site was to get full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) working for all of the desserts listed in the seed data. After achieving this, the next step was to add index pages for each borough included (Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens) and ensure that they were also functional and editable. Once these index pages were all up and running, I decided to add authentication so that only the admin had the ability to change the seed data displayed on the page so as to maintain it as a definitive list. Styling is intended to be playful yet simple and consistent across the pages to allow for a seamless but enjoyable user experience.
